We formulate the problem in following way

We can visualize all runtime exceptions as finite state machine (FSM). When a
program violates such sequence, it throws runtime exception.
In Figure~\ref{fig:array}, array index out of bound (java.lang.
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException) exception is described as a FSM.
Here, a program will be in safe bound as long as the $array\_index \geq 0$ or
$array\_index \leq max\_array\_size - 1$
