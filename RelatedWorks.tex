\section{Recent Works on Data Structure repairing}
\label{sec:RecWorksDataStructure}

Automated data-structure repairing techniques are there in the litarature for
a while. In the papers~\cite{DBLP:conf/oopsla/DemskyR03},
\cite{Demsky03automaticdata}, \cite{DBLP:conf/icse/DemskyR05}, the authors
mostly concentrated on specific data-structures like \emph{FAT-32}, \emph{CTAS} (a
set of air-traffic control tools developed at the NASA Ames
research center) and repairing them.
