\label{chapter:callGraph}

We have used Soot \texttt{CallGraph} class to construct the call-graph of the
candidate repair program. The call graph is essential to detect if there
already exists any exception handling mechanism or not. In case one exists, then
we should skip patching based on the exception type handled in the catch block
otherwise patching effort would change the flow of the program hence may affect
the logic of the same which is not desirable.
