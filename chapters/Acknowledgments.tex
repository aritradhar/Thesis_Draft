This work would not have been possible without support from a number of people.
Foremost, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to Dr. Rahul Purandare for
his expert guidance and for the extremely productive brainstorming sessions I had
with him. I am grateful to my friends, seniors and juniors who offered fresh
perspectives on my research. I am also thankful to IIIT-Delhi for providing
excellent infrastructure and support. Last but never the least, I am immensely
grateful to my parents, family members and close friends, for their invaluable
support and unconditional love.\newline
